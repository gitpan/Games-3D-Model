Games:3D::Model:

2003-03-09 v0.01 Tels - 6 tests
 added:
  * Game::3D::Model - generic base class
  * Game::3D::Model::MD2 - load .md2 models
2003-03-10 v0.02 Tels - 6 tests
  * Uh, everbody uses Games::, so we do, too.
  * fixed bareword problem with GL_COLOR_ARRAY vs GL_COLOR_ARRAY()
  * a bit pointless, but neverthless speed up MD2 rendering by 20-30% by
    cutting array de-refs
  * shaped high-level API in Model by adding states, and morphing between
    frames (and from one state to another), plus a time_warp for each model
    plus "local" time_warp which can modify the morph speed for individual
    models

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
