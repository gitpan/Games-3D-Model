* Currently load/render code and storage is in Perl. Rewrite in XS for more
  speed and a bit less memory-hunger
* morphing/tweening/keyframe animation (e.g. interpolation between frames)
  is missing
* the vector normals are not yet calculated/used
* does not use textures yet

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
