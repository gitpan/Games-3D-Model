Game::3D::Model - load and render 3D model files

DESCRIPTION
===========

This package provides you with 3D model support for your OpenGL Applications
(currently only models with the popular .md2 file format are supported).

For some background information, as well reasoning why this was developed and
why in this way, browse to:

	http://bloodgate.com/perl/sdl/game.html

See SDL::App::FPS for an example model-viewer, which shows MD2 models in an
OpenGL window.

Installation
============

* untar/ungzip the package (replace 0.01 with the version you got)

	tar -xzf Game::3D-Model-0.01.tar.gz

* Check the signature. Download my key from http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc or
  from my CPAN directory. Then do in the build directory (where you unwrapped
  stuff):

	cpansign -v

* if the signature verifies OK, proceed. Otherwise NOTIFY ME IMMIDIATELY. Do
  NOT INSTALL THE PACKAGE! Your system might get compromised!

* Build the make file:

	perl Makefile.PL

* Make the project

	make

* Run the tests:

	make test

* If some tests fail, please notify me.

* If all tests pass, install as root:

	su
	[enter password]
	make install
	exit

Now download SDL::App::FPS from CPAN and look at it's examples to see how to
use this.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
